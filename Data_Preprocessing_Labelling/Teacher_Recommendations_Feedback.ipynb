    "### Idea Behind Teacher Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Option 1: Rule-Based**  \n",
    "- Analyze time-series sentiment and emotion data for each topic over the past 3 months.  \n",
    "- Identify topics with consistently negative sentiment/emotion for improvement and consistently positive sentiment/emotion for recognition.  \n",
    "- Use predefined rules and a dictionary of improvement strategies to generate actionable feedback.  \n",
    "  #### Possibly:\n",
    "  - Could combine with Reinforcement Learning to recommend strategies that lead to positive outcomes for the teacher - indicates by a teacher 'liking' a recommendation:\n",
    "  * After receiving the generated recommendation, the teacher can provide feedback on its usefulness (e.g., \"helpful,\" \"not helpful\").\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The system learns from the teacher's responses to adjust future feedback generation. Positive feedback (e.g., teacher liked the recommendation) increases the likelihood of similar suggestions being generated in the future, while negative feedback reduces the chances of repeating ineffective recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Reward Mechanism: Use a reward-based system where the more a teacher likes certain suggestions, the more those suggestions are prioritized in future recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Option 2: LLMs**  \n",
    "- Pass a summary of each module's sentiment, emotion, and topic trends to an LLM.  \n",
    "- Prompt the LLM to craft detailed and personalised feedback for improvement and recognition based on the trends.  \n",

      "Okay, let's address the negative sentiment and confusion surrounding the 'Content' topic within the Cybersecurity module. Here are three concrete strategies to improve content clarity for the next cycle, focusing on practical, actionable changes:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Deconstruct and Modularize Complex Concepts with Visual Aids:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Problem:** Cybersecurity concepts are often inherently complex and interconnected, making it hard for students to grasp the big picture or individual components. Students may feel overwhelmed by jargon and abstract ideas.\n",
      "* **Strategy:**\n",
      "    * **Break Down into Smaller Modules:** Instead of presenting a large block of information, break down complex topics into smaller, digestible modules. Each module should focus on a single key concept or skill.\n",
      "    * **Create Visual Flowcharts and Diagrams:** Use visual aids like flowcharts, diagrams, and infographics to illustrate the relationships between different concepts, processes, and network components. For example, instead of just explaining how a firewall works, show a diagram of data packets moving through a network and how the firewall acts as a gatekeeper.\n",
      "    * **Use Real-World Examples:** Translate abstract concepts into real-world scenarios that students can relate to. For example, when discussing phishing attacks, show real examples of phishing emails and explain the red flags.\n",
      "    * **Employ Micro-Learning:** Utilize short, focused videos, interactive graphics, or quick quizzes within each module to reinforce the key takeaways and allow students to test their understanding.\n",
      "* **Expected Outcome:** This approach will lead to a more gradual learning curve, allowing students to master each component before moving onto more complex ideas. The visual aids will enhance comprehension by making the abstract more concrete and relatable.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Implement a Layered Approach with Progressive Disclosure and Knowledge Checks:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Problem:** Students might feel lost when foundational knowledge isn't solid, or when too much information is presented at once. They need opportunities to check their understanding and build confidence progressively.\n",
      "* **Strategy:**\n",
      "    * **Start with the Basics:** Ensure a solid foundation is laid by dedicating time to fundamental concepts before moving on to more advanced topics. Review these basics consistently.\n",
      "    * **Progressive Disclosure:** Introduce concepts in layers, starting with a high-level overview and then progressively delving deeper into the details. For instance, when explaining encryption, start by explaining the basic need for secrecy before discussing different encryption algorithms.\n",
      "    * **Regular Knowledge Checks:** Integrate regular knowledge checks (short quizzes, mini-assignments, or thought experiments) at the end of each module or subtopic. These checks shouldn't be high-stakes but should focus on identifying gaps in understanding *immediately*. Provide instant feedback and remediation resources for those struggling.\n",
      "    * **Use a \"Think-Pair-Share\" Approach:** Incorporate moments where students think individually about a concept, then discuss it with a partner, and then share with the class. This can help solidify their understanding and reveal areas of confusion.\n",
      "* **Expected Outcome:** This approach will ensure that students are continuously building their understanding on a solid foundation and are not left behind. The regular knowledge checks will identify areas where students need further support, and the \"Think-Pair-Share\" method will facilitate active learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Develop Interactive Exercises and Practical Application Scenarios:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Problem:** Students often struggle to translate theoretical knowledge into practical application. A lack of hands-on experience can lead to confusion about how concepts work in the real world.\n",
      "* **Strategy:**\n",
      "    * **Create Interactive Exercises:** Design exercises that allow students to interact with the concepts directly. This could include simulations, virtual labs, or gamified challenges. For example, instead of only explaining how to use network scanning tools, have students use a virtual scanner to analyze a virtual network.\n",
      "    * **Develop Scenario-Based Challenges:** Present students with realistic cybersecurity scenarios that require them to apply their knowledge to solve problems. For example, ask them to analyze a suspected malware infection and recommend steps for mitigation.\n",
      "    * **Provide Case Studies:** Use real-world case studies of cybersecurity breaches and incidents to illustrate the importance and application of the concepts they're learning.\n",
      "    * **Encourage Collaborative Problem Solving:** Include group assignments that require students to work together to apply their knowledge to a problem.\n",
      "* **Expected Outcome:** By combining theoretical knowledge with practical application, this approach will help students develop a deeper understanding of the content and increase their confidence in applying what they have learned. It also addresses the \"why\" and not just the \"what,\" making the content more relevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In Summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "These three strategies – **Deconstructing and Modularizing with Visual Aids, Layered Approach with Knowledge Checks, and Interactive Exercises and Practical Application** – provide a multi-pronged approach to enhance content clarity within the Cybersecurity module. By addressing the issues of complexity, pacing, and application, these changes should lead to improved student understanding and a more positive learning experience in the next cycle. Remember to solicit further feedback after these changes have been implemented to ensure they are having the desired impact and make further adjustments as necessary.\n",

    "        \"Okay, let's craft something that can provide teachers with actionable recommendations based on student feedback on their modules. Here's a breakdown of how it could work, along with examples:\\n\\n**Core Components:**\\n\\n1. **Feedback Collection:**\\n   * **Structured Surveys:** This is the most common method. Questions could cover:\\n      * **Clarity of Content:** (e.g., Was the material presented in a clear and understandable way?)\\n      * **Engagement:** (e.g., Did you find the module engaging? Did it hold your interest?)\\n      * **Organization:** (e.g., Was the module well-organized? Did the flow of topics make sense?)\\n      * **Usefulness:** (e.g., How relevant was the material to your learning goals?)\\n      * **Pacing:** (e.g., Was the pace of the module appropriate?)\\n      * **Assessment:** (e.g., Were the assessments fair and aligned with the content?)\\n      * **Instructor's Role:** (e.g., Was the instructor responsive and helpful?)\\n      * **Overall Experience:** (e.g., How satisfied were you with the module overall?)\\n   * **Open-Ended Feedback:** Allow students to provide written comments on what they liked, what they didn't, and suggestions for improvement.\\n   * **Anonymous Feedback:** Encourage honest responses by ensuring anonymity.\\n\\n2. **Data Analysis:**\\n   * **Quantitative Analysis:**\\n      * **Average Scores:** Calculate average scores for each question to identify areas of strength and weakness.\\n      * **Frequency Distributions:** Analyze how often students selected specific responses (e.g., how many students rated a question as \\\"Excellent\\\").\\n      * **Trend Analysis:** Track changes in scores over time to monitor improvement or decline in different areas.\\n   * **Qualitative Analysis:**\\n      * **Theme Identification:** Look for common themes and patterns in the open-ended feedback.\\n      * **Sentiment Analysis:** Use tools to analyze the overall tone (positive, negative, neutral) of the comments.\\n\\n3. **Recommendation Generation:** This is the key part. Here's how to generate meaningful recommendations:\\n   * **Based on Quantitative Data:**\\n      * **Low-Scoring Areas:** If a question consistently scores low, suggest specific actions (e.g., \\\"The question 'Clarity of Content' scored below average. Consider providing more detailed examples or explanations.\\\")\\n      * **Inconsistent Ratings:** If there's a wide spread of ratings, this might indicate that the content appeals to some but not others. Recommend offering optional extensions or different approaches to the material.\\n   * **Based on Qualitative Data:**\\n       * **Recurring Themes:** If multiple students mention that the pacing is too fast, recommend slowing down. If multiple students mention that the instructor's responsiveness is good, highlight this strength.\\n       * **Specific Suggestions:** If a student suggests adding more real-world examples, suggest incorporating them.\\n   * **Focus on Actionable Advice:** Recommendations should be specific and easily translated into concrete changes. Avoid vague statements.\\n   * **Provide Context:** Present data in a way that is clear and understandable for the teacher, along with comparisons to previous years or other similar modules (if available).\\n   * **Highlight Strengths:**  Don't focus solely on weaknesses.  Also include positive feedback to reinforce what is working well.\\n\\n**Example Scenario and Recommendations:**\\n\\n**Scenario:**\\n\\n* **Module:** \\\"Introduction to Programming\\\"\\n* **Feedback:**\\n   * **Quantitative:**  Low average score on the \\\"Clarity of Content\\\" question.\\n   * **Qualitative:**  Multiple students commented that \\\"the concepts were confusing\\\" and \\\"the examples were too abstract.\\\"\\n\\n**Generated Recommendations:**\\n\\n* **Recommendation 1 (Quantitative):**  \\\"The average score for 'Clarity of Content' was 3.2 out of 5, which is below the average for similar introductory modules. Consider reviewing the way key programming concepts are presented. Make use of visual aids, analogies, and step-by-step explanations to enhance clarity.\\\"\\n* **Recommendation 2 (Qualitative):** \\\"Multiple students commented that the concepts were confusing and the examples were too abstract.  Consider incorporating more real-world examples that are directly relatable to student's experiences. For instance, instead of using abstract variables, try a grocery shopping analogy.\\\"\\n* **Recommendation 3 (Qualitative):** \\\"Students also suggested breaking down the code examples into smaller steps. For the next iteration, try creating code walkthroughs where you explain what each line does and why.\\\"\\n* **Positive Reinforcement:** \\\"Students consistently praised your enthusiasm and passion for the subject.\\\"\\n* **Next Steps:** \\\"We recommend reviewing the module materials and incorporating these suggestions for the next iteration. A follow-up session in a few weeks can further help you address any concerns.\\\"\\n\\n**Key Features of a Good Recommendation System:**\\n\\n* **User-Friendly Interface:** The tool should be easy for teachers to use and understand, even if they are not data experts.\\n* **Customizable:** Allow teachers to focus on specific aspects of their teaching.\\n* **Regular Updates:** The tool should provide updated data on a regular basis, allowing teachers to track their progress.\\n* **Support and Resources:** Provide resources and training to help teachers understand the recommendations and implement changes.\\n\\n**Technology to Use:**\\n\\n* **Survey Platforms:** (e.g., Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, Typeform)\\n* **Data Analysis Tools:** (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets, Python with Pandas, R)\\n* **Visualization Tools:** (e.g., Tableau, Power BI)\\n* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**  For more advanced qualitative analysis\\n\\nBy implementing a comprehensive system for collecting, analyzing, and generating recommendations based on student feedback, teachers can gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of their modules, leading to a more engaging and effective learning experience for students. Remember that this is an iterative process. Regularly collect feedback and refine your approach to continually improve your teaching.\\n\",\n",

      "Okay, this is a very clear and concerning picture for the \"Programming\" module. The low average rating (2.6), overwhelmingly negative sentiment (85.7%), high levels of frustration (85.7%), and lack of specific concerns in the feedback topics all point towards a fundamental issue with the module's delivery, likely related to clarity and perhaps engagement. The January 2025 dip is also a crucial piece of information, suggesting a potential change or issue introduced during that period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are three concrete strategies to improve content clarity for the next cycle, specifically addressing the identified problems:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strategy 1: \"Deconstruct & Rebuild\" Core Concepts with Micro-Learning Modules**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Problem Addressed:** The overall lack of clarity and high frustration suggests students are struggling with the fundamental concepts. The lack of specific feedback on topics suggests the problem is pervasive across the module, not isolated.\n",
      "*   **Actionable Steps:**\n",
      "    1.  **Identify Core Pain Points:** Revisit the module curriculum and identify 3-5 core concepts that are foundational for the module. These are likely the concepts that are causing the most confusion.\n",
      "    2.  **Break Down into Micro-Modules:** For each core concept, create a series of short, focused \"micro-modules\" (5-10 minutes each). Each micro-module should:\n",
      "        *   Focus on a *single* learning objective.\n",
      "        *   Start with a clear and simple explanation.\n",
      "        *   Include visual aids (diagrams, code visualizations, infographics) to support understanding.\n",
      "        *   Use real-world analogies or examples to make the concept relatable.\n",
      "        *   Include a short, low-stakes practice exercise or quiz for immediate feedback.\n",
      "    3.  **Progressive Learning Path:** Organize the micro-modules in a logical progression, building upon previous concepts.\n",
      "    4.  **Regular Review:** Schedule regular mini-review sessions (short quizzes or recaps) after every few micro-modules.\n",
      "*   **Why it Works:** Breaking down complex topics into smaller, manageable chunks makes them less intimidating and easier to digest. The visual aids and real-world examples address the abstract nature that is likely causing confusion. The practice exercises ensure students are actively engaged and can identify gaps in their understanding early on.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strategy 2: \"Code-Along & Walkthrough\" Intensive Guided Practice**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Problem Addressed:** The lack of specific feedback could mean that students are struggling with the application of concepts, rather than the concepts themselves. They might not know *how* to use the information they've been given.\n",
      "*   **Actionable Steps:**\n",
      "    1.  **Incorporate \"Code-Along\" Activities:** For each core concept and related practice, develop a \"code-along\" activity where the lecturer demonstrates the coding process step-by-step, explaining each line of code and the reasoning behind it.\n",
      "    2.  **Provide Detailed Walkthroughs:** Create detailed walkthroughs (written or video) of examples and assignments, explaining the problem-solving process and the code structure.\n",
      "    3.  **Encourage Active Participation:** During live sessions, encourage students to code along with the lecturer and ask questions.\n",
      "    4.  **Offer Multiple Solutions:** Where appropriate, present alternative coding approaches and explain the pros and cons of each.\n",
      "    5.  **Focus on Debugging:** Include exercises that require students to debug code, teaching them how to identify and fix errors.\n",
      "*   **Why it Works:** This approach moves beyond passive learning and actively engages students in the coding process. The step-by-step guidance helps them see how concepts translate into code, and the debugging practice develops practical problem-solving skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strategy 3: \"Feedback & Iteration\" Focused Early Check-ins**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Problem Addressed:** The lack of specific feedback might indicate students are struggling silently and not feeling comfortable enough to voice their concerns. This strategy tackles that directly.\n",
      "*   **Actionable Steps:**\n",
      "    1.  **Implement Early Check-In Points:** Introduce regular, low-stakes check-in points throughout the module (e.g., after each micro-module, or weekly).\n",
      "    2.  **Use Targeted Questions:** Instead of general feedback requests, ask focused questions that target specific aspects of clarity (e.g., \"Was the explanation of variable scope clear? What was the most confusing part of the code-along?\").\n",
      "    3.  **Provide Timely Feedback:** Respond to student feedback promptly and make adjustments to the module content or teaching approach as needed.\n",
      "    4.  **Create a Safe Space for Questions:** Emphasize that questions are welcome and valuable. Encourage students to ask even if they think their question is \"basic.\"\n",
      "    5.  **Use Anonymous Feedback:** Provide a way for students to give anonymous feedback if they are uncomfortable speaking up.\n",
      "*   **Why it Works:** Early and targeted feedback allows the lecturer to identify problems quickly and make necessary changes before students get too frustrated. It creates a feedback loop that allows the module to continually improve. The encouragement of questions ensures that students feel comfortable seeking help when they need it.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Implementation Notes:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Start Small:** Don't try to implement all these strategies at once. Start with one or two and gradually add more.\n",
      "*   **Monitor and Adapt:** Regularly monitor student feedback and adjust your approach as needed.\n",
      "*   **Be Transparent:** Explain to students why you are making these changes and how their feedback is being used to improve the module.\n",
      "\n",
      "By focusing on these three strategies – breaking down concepts, providing guided practice, and fostering a feedback loop – you can directly address the core issues of clarity and frustration in the \"Programming\" module and create a much more positive learning experience for your students. Remember that the goal is not just to deliver content, but to ensure that students truly *understand* it.\n",

Here's a breakdown of how it could work, along with examples:\\n\\n**Core Components:**\\n\\n1. **Feedback Collection:**\\n   * **Structured Surveys:** This is the most common method. Questions could cover:\\n      * **Clarity of Content:** (e.g., Was the material presented in a clear and understandable way?)\\n      * **Engagement:** (e.g., Did you find the module engaging? Did it hold your interest?)\\n      * **Organization:** (e.g., Was the module well-organized? Did the flow of topics make sense?)\\n      * **Usefulness:** (e.g., How relevant was the material to your learning goals?)\\n      * **Pacing:** (e.g., Was the pace of the module appropriate?)\\n      * **Assessment:** (e.g., Were the assessments fair and aligned with the content?)\\n      * **Instructor's Role:** (e.g., Was the instructor responsive and helpful?)\\n      * **Overall Experience:** (e.g., How satisfied were you with the module overall?)\\n   * **Open-Ended Feedback:** Allow students to provide written comments on what they liked, what they didn't, and suggestions for improvement.\\n   * **Anonymous Feedback:** Encourage honest responses by ensuring anonymity.\\n\\n2. **Data Analysis:**\\n   * **Quantitative Analysis:**\\n      * **Average Scores:** Calculate average scores for each question to identify areas of strength and weakness.\\n      * **Frequency Distributions:** Analyze how often students selected specific responses (e.g., how many students rated a question as \\\"Excellent\\\").\\n      * **Trend Analysis:** Track changes in scores over time to monitor improvement or decline in different areas.\\n   * **Qualitative Analysis:**\\n      * **Theme Identification:** Look for common themes and patterns in the open-ended feedback.\\n      * **Sentiment Analysis:** Use tools to analyze the overall tone (positive, negative, neutral) of the comments.\\n\\n3. **Recommendation Generation:** This is the key part. Here's how to generate meaningful recommendations:\\n   * **Based on Quantitative Data:**\\n      * **Low-Scoring Areas:** If a question consistently scores low, suggest specific actions (e.g., \\\"The question 'Clarity of Content' scored below average. Consider providing more detailed examples or explanations.\\\")\\n      * **Inconsistent Ratings:** If there's a wide spread of ratings, this might indicate that the content appeals to some but not others. Recommend offering optional extensions or different approaches to the material.\\n   * **Based on Qualitative Data:**\\n       * **Recurring Themes:** If multiple students mention that the pacing is too fast, recommend slowing down. If multiple students mention that the instructor's responsiveness is good, highlight this strength.\\n       * **Specific Suggestions:** If a student suggests adding more real-world examples, suggest incorporating them.\\n   * **Focus on Actionable Advice:** Recommendations should be specific and easily translated into concrete changes. Avoid vague statements.\\n   * **Provide Context:** Present data in a way that is clear and understandable for the teacher, along with comparisons to previous years or other similar modules (if available).\\n   * **Highlight Strengths:**  Don't focus solely on weaknesses.  Also include positive feedback to reinforce what is working well.\\n\\n**Example Scenario and Recommendations:**\\n\\n**Scenario:**\\n\\n* **Module:** \\\"Introduction to Programming\\\"\\n* **Feedback:**\\n   * **Quantitative:**  Low average score on the \\\"Clarity of Content\\\" question.\\n   * **Qualitative:**  Multiple students commented that \\\"the concepts were confusing\\\" and \\\"the examples were too abstract.\\\"\\n\\n**Generated Recommendations:**\\n\\n* **Recommendation 1 (Quantitative):**  \\\"The average score for 'Clarity of Content' was 3.2 out of 5, which is below the average for similar introductory modules. Consider reviewing the way key programming concepts are presented. Make use of visual aids, analogies, and step-by-step explanations to enhance clarity.\\\"\\n* **Recommendation 2 (Qualitative):** \\\"Multiple students commented that the concepts were confusing and the examples were too abstract.  Consider incorporating more real-world examples that are directly relatable to student's experiences. For instance, instead of using abstract variables, try a grocery shopping analogy.\\\"\\n* **Recommendation 3 (Qualitative):** \\\"Students also suggested breaking down the code examples into smaller steps. For the next iteration, try creating code walkthroughs where you explain what each line does and why.\\\"\\n* **Positive Reinforcement:** \\\"Students consistently praised your enthusiasm and passion for the subject.\\\"\\n* **Next Steps:** \\\"We recommend reviewing the module materials and incorporating these suggestions for the next iteration. A follow-up session in a few weeks can further help you address any concerns.\\\"\\n\\n**Key Features of a Good Recommendation System:**\\n\\n* **User-Friendly Interface:** The tool should be easy for teachers to use and understand, even if they are not data experts.\\n* **Customizable:** Allow teachers to focus on specific aspects of their teaching.\\n* **Regular Updates:** The tool should provide updated data on a regular basis, allowing teachers to track their progress.\\n* **Support and Resources:** Provide resources and training to help teachers understand the recommendations and implement changes.\\n\\n**Technology to Use:**\\n\\n* **Survey Platforms:** (e.g., Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, Typeform)\\n* **Data Analysis Tools:** (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets, Python with Pandas, R)\\n* **Visualization Tools:** (e.g., Tableau, Power BI)\\n* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**  For more advanced qualitative analysis\\n\\nBy implementing a comprehensive system for collecting, analyzing, and generating recommendations based on student feedback, teachers can gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of their modules, leading to a more engaging and effective learning experience for students. Remember that this is an iterative process. Regularly collect feedback and refine your approach to continually improve your teaching.\\n\",\n",

To address this, consider allowing more time for the exam or reducing the number of questions. You may also want to review the difficulty level to ensure it is appropriate for the learning outcomes.\\n*   **Assignment:** Students are dissatisfied with the resources provided for the assignments. Improving the clarity, accessibility and relevance of the resources is critical.\\n*  **Lecturer:**  Students have issues with the lecturer's teaching style. To address this, please review and enhance the teaching approach with more active, engaging methods.\\n*   **Grading:** Students believe the grading is not fair.  You should re-evaluate the grading criteria and ensure they are transparent, consistent, and clearly communicated to students.\\n\\nThe issues were particularly pronounced in 2025-01. It is imperative to address these concerns urgently to enhance student satisfaction and learning outcomes in this module.\\\"\\n\\n**How the Prompt Adapts:**\\n\\n*   **Positive Feedback:** If the average rating and sentiment were positive, the prompt would shift to highlighting the positive points, for example:\\n    *   \\\"This module received positive feedback with an average rating of 4.5 and 90% positive sentiment.

It sounds like you've got some areas where students are feeling frustrated, and that can be tough to hear.\\n\\nOverall, the feedback on your module is **largely negative**, with students feeling **high levels of frustration**. This seems mainly because students are concerned about:\\n\\n*   **Exam:** The time constraints and difficulty of the exam are a major point of concern. To address this, you might consider reducing the number of questions on the paper or extending the time allowed for the exam. This could help ease the pressure students feel. You could also review the exam questions to ensure they are aligned with the module learning outcomes and difficulty level.\\n*   **Assignment:** Students have indicated there is a lack of resources available for assignments. Perhaps reviewing the current resources and seeing if additional material is needed, or if the available material can be made clearer would be helpful. You could consider adding supplemental material, pointers, or more detailed instructions to enhance student understanding.\\n*   **Lecturer:** The teaching style of the lecturer is also a concern for students. It could be helpful to explore how the course is being taught to see if there are other teaching approaches that would engage students more effectively. Maybe try to incorporate some more active learning techniques, or look into other methods that could make the content more accessible.\\n*   **Grading:** Finally, there are concerns about the fairness of the grading. Reviewing and clarifying the grading criteria with students, and providing rubrics of how grades will be awarded could be a step to consider. This could improve the level of trust and transparency of the grading.\\n\\nLooking at the time trend, it appears the issues were most pronounced in 2025-01, so this might be a good area to focus on.\\n\\nThese are just a few ideas, of course. I'm here to help you explore all the options and improve the experience for your students, and I am confident that by addressing these specific points, the situation can improve.\\\"\\n\\n**Key Features of This Response:**\\n\\n*   **Empathetic Opening:** Phrases like \\\"It sounds like you've got some areas where students are feeling frustrated, and that can be tough to hear\\\" acknowledges the emotional impact of negative feedback.\\n*   **Non-Authoritative Language:** The use of phrases like \\\"you might consider,\\\" \\\"perhaps,\\\" \\\"it could be helpful,\\\" and \\\"maybe try to\\\" makes the suggestions feel less like dictates and more like helpful ideas. It takes away the \\\"expert\\\" tone and offers advice, not commands.\\n*   **Specific Examples:** Each suggestion includes a concrete example of how the identified problem could be addressed. This includes actionable ideas like \\\"reducing the number of questions\\\" or \\\"providing rubrics\\\".\\n*   **Structured Format:** Each concern (exam, assignment, lecturer, grading) is addressed individually for clarity.\\n*   **Focus on Improvement:** The response focuses on helping the teacher improve, not dwelling on the negative feedback itself.\\n*   **Positive Ending:** The response ends on a note of support and confidence in the teacher's ability to improve the situation.\\n*   **Focus on the Data:** The inclusion of \\\"looking at the time trend, it appears the issues were most pronounced in 2025-01\\\" reinforces the idea that the suggestions are backed by the data, not arbitrary recommendations.\\n\\n**How to Use This:**\\n\\nWhen prompting the chatbot, you can include instructions like:\\n\\n\\\"Please generate a response that acknowledges that feedback can be difficult to receive. Your response should be non-authoritative, offering suggestions rather than commands, and mindful of the teacher's feelings. Please provide specific and actionable recommendations. Include a positive ending.\\\"\\n\\nBy providing these guidelines to the chatbot, you should receive a response that is more helpful and less likely to overwhelm the teacher with seemingly harsh or prescriptive advice. Remember to further question the chatbot to tailor the advice even further.\\n\",\n",

To address this, consider allowing more time for the exam or reducing the number of questions. You may also want to review the difficulty level to ensure it is appropriate for the learning outcomes.\\n*   **Assignment:** Students are dissatisfied with the resources provided for the assignments. Improving the clarity, accessibility and relevance of the resources is critical.\\n*  **Lecturer:**  Students have issues with the lecturer's teaching style. To address this, please review and enhance the teaching approach with more active, engaging methods.\\n*   **Grading:** Students believe the grading is not fair.  You should re-evaluate the grading criteria and ensure they are transparent, consistent, and clearly communicated to students.\\n\\nThe issues were particularly pronounced in 2025-01. It is imperative to address these concerns urgently to enhance student satisfaction and learning outcomes in this module.\\\"\\n\\n**How the Prompt Adapts:**\\n\\n*   **Positive Feedback:** If the average rating and sentiment were positive, the prompt would shift to highlighting the positive points, for example:\\n    *   \\\"This module received positive feedback with an average rating of 4.5 and 90% positive sentiment. Students are pleased with the...\\\" \\n    *   \\\"Students praise the lecturer's engagement and accessibility. Please continue the excellent work\\\"\\n*   **Mixed Feedback:** If there was a mix of positive and negative feedback, I would generate prompts that acknowledges both and highlights areas for improvement.\\n    *   \\\"The module received mixed feedback, with an average rating of 3.5. While students expressed satisfaction with the teaching style of the lecturer, there are concerns about the resources provided for assignments.\\\"\\n\\n**Key Improvements of the Prompt:**\\n\\n*   **Actionable Recommendations:**  The prompt doesn't just state problems; it gives concrete, actionable suggestions for improvement.\\n*   **Specific and Tailored:** Recommendations are tied directly to specific feedback topics.\\n*   **Contextualized:** Time-based trends add context to the issues.\\n*   **Urgency (if needed):** If feedback is severely negative, it conveys a sense of urgency.\\n\\n**How to Use This:**\\n\\n1.  **Feed the Data:** Give me the structured data like you provided.\\n2.  **Receive a Prompt:** I will generate a tailored prompt based on the analysis.\\n3.  **Use the Prompt:** Use my prompt as a basis for developing reports, informing instructors, or designing improvements to your educational module.\\n\\nLet me know if you have any other scenarios you'd like to explore or if you want to refine this approach further!

You want the chatbot to generate feedback recommendations that are:\\n\\n*   **Non-authoritative:** Not coming across as an expert, but rather as a helpful assistant offering suggestions.\\n*   **Empathetic:** Mindful of the teacher's feelings, especially considering the negative feedback received.\\n*   **Specific:** Providing concrete examples, just as mentioned in your example about the exam.\\n*   **Structured:** Addressing each topic (exam, assignment, lecturer, grading) individually.\\n\\nHere's how I'd frame a chatbot response that meets those criteria:\\n\\n**Example Chatbot Response:**\\n\\n\\\"Okay, let's look at this feedback for the 'Programming' module together. It sounds like you've got some areas where students are feeling frustrated, and that can be tough to hear.\\n\\nOverall, the feedback on your module is **largely negative**, with students feeling **high levels of frustration**. This seems mainly because students are concerned about:\\n\\n*   **Exam:** The time constraints and difficulty of the exam are a major point of concern. To address this, you might consider reducing the number of questions on the paper or extending the time allowed for the exam. This could help ease the pressure students feel. You could also review the exam questions to ensure they are aligned with the module learning outcomes and difficulty level.\\n*   **Assignment:** Students have indicated there is a lack of resources available for assignments. Perhaps reviewing the current resources and seeing if additional material is needed, or if the available material can be made clearer would be helpful. You could consider adding supplemental material, pointers, or more detailed instructions to enhance student understanding.\\n*   **Lecturer:** The teaching style of the lecturer is also a concern for students. It could be helpful to explore how the course is being taught to see if there are other teaching approaches that would engage students more effectively. Maybe try to incorporate some more active learning techniques, or look into other methods that could make the content more accessible.\\n*   **Grading:** Finally, there are concerns about the fairness of the grading. Reviewing and clarifying the grading criteria with students, and providing rubrics of how grades will be awarded could be a step to consider. This could improve the level of trust and transparency of the grading.\\n\\nLooking at the time trend, it appears the issues were most pronounced in 2025-01, so this might be a good area to focus on.\\n\\nThese are just a few ideas, of course. I'm here to help you explore all the options and improve the experience for your students, and I am confident that by addressing these specific points, the situation can improve.\\\"\\n\\n**Key Features of This Response:**\\n\\n*   **Empathetic Opening:** Phrases like \\\"It sounds like you've got some areas where students are feeling frustrated, and that can be tough to hear\\\" acknowledges the emotional impact of negative feedback.\\n*   **Non-Authoritative Language:** The use of phrases like \\\"you might consider,\\\" \\\"perhaps,\\\" \\\"it could be helpful,\\\" and \\\"maybe try to\\\" makes the suggestions feel less like dictates and more like helpful ideas. It takes away the \\\"expert\\\" tone and offers advice, not commands.\\n*   **Specific Examples:** Each suggestion includes a concrete example of how the identified problem could be addressed. This includes actionable ideas like \\\"reducing the number of questions\\\" or \\\"providing rubrics\\\".\\n*   **Structured Format:** Each concern (exam, assignment, lecturer, grading) is addressed individually for clarity.\\n*   **Focus on Improvement:** The response focuses on helping the teacher improve, not dwelling on the negative feedback itself.\\n*   **Positive Ending:** The response ends on a note of support and confidence in the teacher's ability to improve the situation.\\n*   **Focus on the Data:** The inclusion of \\\"looking at the time trend, it appears the issues were most pronounced in 2025-01\\\" reinforces the idea that the suggestions are backed by the data, not arbitrary recommendations.\\n\\n**How to Use This:**\\n\\nWhen prompting the chatbot, you can include instructions like:\\n\\n\\\"Please generate a response that acknowledges that feedback can be difficult to receive. Your response should be non-authoritative, offering suggestions rather than commands, and mindful of the teacher's feelings. Please provide specific and actionable recommendations. Include a positive ending.\\\"\\n\\nBy providing these guidelines to the chatbot, you should receive a response that is more helpful and less likely to overwhelm the teacher with seemingly harsh or prescriptive advice. Remember to further question the chatbot to tailor the advice even further.\\n\",\n",

    "        \"Okay, let's craft something that can provide teachers with actionable recommendations based on student feedback on their modules. Here's a breakdown of how it could work, along with examples:\\n\\n**Core Components:**\\n\\n1. **Feedback Collection:**\\n   * **Structured Surveys:** This is the most common method. Questions could cover:\\n      * **Clarity of Content:** (e.g., Was the material presented in a clear and understandable way?)\\n      * **Engagement:** (e.g., Did you find the module engaging? Did it hold your interest?)\\n      * **Organization:** (e.g., Was the module well-organized? Did the flow of topics make sense?)\\n      * **Usefulness:** (e.g., How relevant was the material to your learning goals?)\\n      * **Pacing:** (e.g., Was the pace of the module appropriate?)\\n      * **Assessment:** (e.g., Were the assessments fair and aligned with the content?)\\n      * **Instructor's Role:** (e.g., Was the instructor responsive and helpful?)\\n      * **Overall Experience:** (e.g., How satisfied were you with the module overall?)\\n   * **Open-Ended Feedback:** Allow students to provide written comments on what they liked, what they didn't, and suggestions for improvement.\\n   * **Anonymous Feedback:** Encourage honest responses by ensuring anonymity.\\n\\n2. **Data Analysis:**\\n   * **Quantitative Analysis:**\\n      * **Average Scores:** Calculate average scores for each question to identify areas of strength and weakness.\\n      * **Frequency Distributions:** Analyze how often students selected specific responses (e.g., how many students rated a question as \\\"Excellent\\\").\\n      * **Trend Analysis:** Track changes in scores over time to monitor improvement or decline in different areas.\\n   * **Qualitative Analysis:**\\n      * **Theme Identification:** Look for common themes and patterns in the open-ended feedback.\\n      * **Sentiment Analysis:** Use tools to analyze the overall tone (positive, negative, neutral) of the comments.\\n\\n3. **Recommendation Generation:** This is the key part. Here's how to generate meaningful recommendations:\\n   * **Based on Quantitative Data:**\\n      * **Low-Scoring Areas:** If a question consistently scores low, suggest specific actions (e.g., \\\"The question 'Clarity of Content' scored below average. Consider providing more detailed examples or explanations.\\\")\\n      * **Inconsistent Ratings:** If there's a wide spread of ratings, this might indicate that the content appeals to some but not others. Recommend offering optional extensions or different approaches to the material.\\n   * **Based on Qualitative Data:**\\n       * **Recurring Themes:** If multiple students mention that the pacing is too fast, recommend slowing down. If multiple students mention that the instructor's responsiveness is good, highlight this strength.\\n       * **Specific Suggestions:** If a student suggests adding more real-world examples, suggest incorporating them.\\n   * **Focus on Actionable Advice:** Recommendations should be specific and easily translated into concrete changes. Avoid vague statements.\\n   * **Provide Context:** Present data in a way that is clear and understandable for the teacher, along with comparisons to previous years or other similar modules (if available).\\n   * **Highlight Strengths:**  Don't focus solely on weaknesses.  Also include positive feedback to reinforce what is working well.\\n\\n**Example Scenario and Recommendations:**\\n\\n**Scenario:**\\n\\n* **Module:** \\\"Introduction to Programming\\\"\\n* **Feedback:**\\n   * **Quantitative:**  Low average score on the \\\"Clarity of Content\\\" question.\\n   * **Qualitative:**  Multiple students commented that \\\"the concepts were confusing\\\" and \\\"the examples were too abstract.\\\"\\n\\n**Generated Recommendations:**\\n\\n* **Recommendation 1 (Quantitative):**  \\\"The average score for 'Clarity of Content' was 3.2 out of 5, which is below the average for similar introductory modules. Consider reviewing the way key programming concepts are presented. Make use of visual aids, analogies, and step-by-step explanations to enhance clarity.\\\"\\n* **Recommendation 2 (Qualitative):** \\\"Multiple students commented that the concepts were confusing and the examples were too abstract.  Consider incorporating more real-world examples that are directly relatable to student's experiences. For instance, instead of using abstract variables, try a grocery shopping analogy.\\\"\\n* **Recommendation 3 (Qualitative):** \\\"Students also suggested breaking down the code examples into smaller steps. For the next iteration, try creating code walkthroughs where you explain what each line does and why.\\\"\\n* **Positive Reinforcement:** \\\"Students consistently praised your enthusiasm and passion for the subject.\\\"\\n* **Next Steps:** \\\"We recommend reviewing the module materials and incorporating these suggestions for the next iteration. A follow-up session in a few weeks can further help you address any concerns.\\\"\\n\\n**Key Features of a Good Recommendation System:**\\n\\n* **User-Friendly Interface:** The tool should be easy for teachers to use and understand, even if they are not data experts.\\n* **Customizable:** Allow teachers to focus on specific aspects of their teaching.\\n* **Regular Updates:** The tool should provide updated data on a regular basis, allowing teachers to track their progress.\\n* **Support and Resources:** Provide resources and training to help teachers understand the recommendations and implement changes.\\n\\n**Technology to Use:**\\n\\n* **Survey Platforms:** (e.g., Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, Typeform)\\n* **Data Analysis Tools:** (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets, Python with Pandas, R)\\n* **Visualization Tools:** (e.g., Tableau, Power BI)\\n* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**  For more advanced qualitative analysis\\n\\nBy implementing a comprehensive system for collecting, analyzing, and generating recommendations based on student feedback, teachers can gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of their modules, leading to a more engaging and effective learning experience for students.

    "        \"Okay, let's craft something that can provide teachers with actionable recommendations based on student feedback on their modules. Here's a breakdown of how it could work, along with examples:\\n\\n**Core Components:**\\n\\n1. **Feedback Collection:**\\n   * **Structured Surveys:** This is the most common method. Questions could cover:\\n      * **Clarity of Content:** (e.g., Was the material presented in a clear and understandable way?)\\n      * **Engagement:** (e.g., Did you find the module engaging? Did it hold your interest?)\\n      * **Organization:** (e.g., Was the module well-organized? Did the flow of topics make sense?)\\n      * **Usefulness:** (e.g., How relevant was the material to your learning goals?)\\n      * **Pacing:** (e.g., Was the pace of the module appropriate?)\\n      * **Assessment:** (e.g., Were the assessments fair and aligned with the content?)\\n      * **Instructor's Role:** (e.g., Was the instructor responsive and helpful?)\\n      * **Overall Experience:** (e.g., How satisfied were you with the module overall?)\\n   * **Open-Ended Feedback:** Allow students to provide written comments on what they liked, what they didn't, and suggestions for improvement.\\n   * **Anonymous Feedback:** Encourage honest responses by ensuring anonymity.\\n\\n2. **Data Analysis:**\\n   * **Quantitative Analysis:**\\n      * **Average Scores:** Calculate average scores for each question to identify areas of strength and weakness.\\n      * **Frequency Distributions:** Analyze how often students selected specific responses (e.g., how many students rated a question as \\\"Excellent\\\").\\n      * **Trend Analysis:** Track changes in scores over time to monitor improvement or decline in different areas.\\n   * **Qualitative Analysis:**\\n      * **Theme Identification:** Look for common themes and patterns in the open-ended feedback.\\n      * **Sentiment Analysis:** Use tools to analyze the overall tone (positive, negative, neutral) of the comments.\\n\\n3. **Recommendation Generation:** This is the key part. Here's how to generate meaningful recommendations:\\n   * **Based on Quantitative Data:**\\n      * **Low-Scoring Areas:** If a question consistently scores low, suggest specific actions (e.g., \\\"The question 'Clarity of Content' scored below average. Consider providing more detailed examples or explanations.\\\")\\n      * **Inconsistent Ratings:** If there's a wide spread of ratings, this might indicate that the content appeals to some but not others. Recommend offering optional extensions or different approaches to the material.\\n   * **Based on Qualitative Data:**\\n       * **Recurring Themes:** If multiple students mention that the pacing is too fast, recommend slowing down. If multiple students mention that the instructor's responsiveness is good, highlight this strength.\\n       * **Specific Suggestions:** If a student suggests adding more real-world examples, suggest incorporating them.\\n   * **Focus on Actionable Advice:** Recommendations should be specific and easily translated into concrete changes. Avoid vague statements.\\n   * **Provide Context:** Present data in a way that is clear and understandable for the teacher, along with comparisons to previous years or other similar modules (if available).\\n   * **Highlight Strengths:**  Don't focus solely on weaknesses.  Also include positive feedback to reinforce what is working well.\\n\\n**Example Scenario and Recommendations:**\\n\\n**Scenario:**\\n\\n* **Module:** \\\"Introduction to Programming\\\"\\n* **Feedback:**\\n   * **Quantitative:**  Low average score on the \\\"Clarity of Content\\\" question.\\n   * **Qualitative:**  Multiple students commented that \\\"the concepts were confusing\\\" and \\\"the examples were too abstract.\\\"\\n\\n**Generated Recommendations:**\\n\\n* **Recommendation 1 (Quantitative):**  \\\"The average score for 'Clarity of Content' was 3.2 out of 5, which is below the average for similar introductory modules. Consider reviewing the way key programming concepts are presented. Make use of visual aids, analogies, and step-by-step explanations to enhance clarity.\\\"\\n* **Recommendation 2 (Qualitative):** \\\"Multiple students commented that the concepts were confusing and the examples were too abstract.  Consider incorporating more real-world examples that are directly relatable to student's experiences. For instance, instead of using abstract variables, try a grocery shopping analogy.\\\"\\n* **Recommendation 3 (Qualitative):** \\\"Students also suggested breaking down the code examples into smaller steps. For the next iteration, try creating code walkthroughs where you explain what each line does and why.\\\"\\n* **Positive Reinforcement:** \\\"Students consistently praised your enthusiasm and passion for the subject.\\\"\\n* **Next Steps:** \\\"We recommend reviewing the module materials and incorporating these suggestions for the next iteration. A follow-up session in a few weeks can further help you address any concerns.\\\"\\n\\n**Key Features of a Good Recommendation System:**\\n\\n* **User-Friendly Interface:** The tool should be easy for teachers to use and understand, even if they are not data experts.\\n* **Customizable:** Allow teachers to focus on specific aspects of their teaching.\\n* **Regular Updates:** The tool should provide updated data on a regular basis, allowing teachers to track their progress.\\n* **Support and Resources:** Provide resources and training to help teachers understand the recommendations and implement changes.\\n\\n**Technology to Use:**\\n\\n* **Survey Platforms:** (e.g., Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, Typeform)\\n* **Data Analysis Tools:** (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets, Python with Pandas, R)\\n* **Visualization Tools:** (e.g., Tableau, Power BI)\\n* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**  For more advanced qualitative analysis\\n\\nBy implementing a comprehensive system for collecting, analyzing, and generating recommendations based on student feedback, teachers can gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of their modules, leading to a more engaging and effective learning experience for students. Remember that this is an iterative process. Regularly collect feedback and refine your approach to continually improve your teaching.\\n\",\n",
